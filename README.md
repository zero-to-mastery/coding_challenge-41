Build your own VS Code extension!


### The Challenge:
If you have ever wanted to build your own VS Code extension to improve your developer experience, to add to your portfolio, or to just have fun, then this challenge is for you! **This month, we are all going to build our own VS Code extension**. But how do you even do that!? Lucky for you, ZTM programmer-extrodinaire **Cindy has created a demo VS Code extension, as well as a helpful guide to get you started**. [You can find the guide, plus the code of her example extension here](https://github.com/LanguageXange/vscode). From there, you can copy what you like and customize the plugin to your liking. Let's get creative and see what you can build!

1. https://github.com/LanguageXange/vscode (This demo extension built by Cindy allows you to search the [ZTM](https://zerotomastery.io) website's blog posts! Check out the ReadMe to get a tutorial on how it was built. Finally, as a thank you to Cindy, give that repo a STAR!
2. Inside of the repository above, you can find the [extensions.js](https://github.com/LanguageXange/vscode/blob/master/extension.js) file which contains the code you can customize to make your plugin do whatever you like. 


### The Rules Are:

1. You will need to follow the instructions/tutorial above to build your project.

2. **You have until September 30th at 11:59pm EST** to submit your project (using Github. If you don't know how to do that, check out the lecture in the Git + Github section of the course). You will have to submit the link to the **#coding-challenge** Discord group with the following message:  *-challenge URL LINK TO YOUR ENTRY"* . The bot will listen for the command and will reply with "thanks for your submission" if it succeeded.

4. Use whatever tools you have as developers (google, friends, Discord, programming buddy etc...) but I will not be offering any help with this challenge. Just like a developer, you must solve a problem and create something unique. Nobody will hold your hand during the job so we want to experience that by figuring it all out on your own with your team. 

## Submissions:

Student Submissions will be posted here at the end of the challenge:


## One Last Thing!

**Please note: As with all of our challenges, there is zero benefit or monetary gain we receive from it. This is just our way of extending the classroom and making sure that you are able to continue gaining valuable knowledge outside of the courses.**
